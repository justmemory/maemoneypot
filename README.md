# maemoneypot
An expense, income and saving tracker for Nokia N900 with some extended functions such as different views, graphs.

# ToDo
- Apply details view for incomes and savings
- Connect savings and expense more
- Add export-import-backup functionality
- Make multiple edition available (e.g. whole category)
- Full portrait support - this is quite a good question on n900... Relayout windows on rotation if there is a graph
- More report options (more charts, report between dates, compare years/categories, etc.)
- Make "add budget" option available
- Make bill/reminder option available
- Make recurring expense/income/saving option available
- Automatic rollover between months
